          <p class="lead">The NeST seminars are a series of talks, followed by informal discussions, on topics relating the study of large dynamic networks and the themes covered in the <a href="https://nest-programme.ac.uk/" class="link-dark">NeST programme</a>. Each seminar is one hour long and takes place virtually, on Microsoft Teams.</p>

                  <b>Anru Zhang</b> (Duke University): High-order Singular Value Decomposition in Tensor Analysis
                  <div class="publication-authors" style="text-align:justify">
                    <b>Abstract:</b>  The analysis of tensor data, i.e., arrays with multiple directions, is motivated by a wide range of scientific applications and has become an important interdisciplinary topic in data science. In this talk, we discuss the fundamental task of performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on tensors, exploring both general cases and scenarios with specific structures like smoothness and longitudinality. Through the developed frameworks, we can achieve accurate denoising for 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy images; in longitudinal microbiome studies, we can extract key components in the trajectories of bacterial abundance, identify representative bacterial taxa for these key trajectories, and group subjects based on the change of bacteria abundance over time. We also showcase the development of statistically optimal methods and computationally efficient algorithms that harness valuable insights from high-dimensional tensor data, grounded in theories of computation and non-convex optimization.

                  <b>Riccardo Rastelli</b> (University College Dublin): A latent position model for multivariate time series analysis
                  <div class="publication-authors">
                    <b>Abstract:</b>  Multivariate time series models can suffer from overparameterization and difficult interpretability of the model parameters. In this talk, I will introduce a new statistical framework where we combine some recent network models with vector autoregressive models. The network approach is based on latent variables and, in particular, on a latent space visualization of the time series data. This formulation enables a parsimonious dependency structure and it provides new model-based visualizations of the data. In addition, the temporal aspects of the time series are naturally modeled using dynamic networks models. Hence, I will go through different variants of the proposed model, characterizing some of its properties and highlighting its performance on simulated datasets. Finally, I will propose a study on the number of recorded mumps cases in England during the last decade.Â

                  <b>Eric Kolaczyk</b> (McGill University): Coevolving Latent Space Network with Attractors Models for Polarization
                  <div class="publication-authors">
                    <b>Abstract:</b>  I will present a broadly applicable class of coevolving latent space network with attractors (CLSNA) models, where nodes represent individual social actors assumed to lie in an unknown latent space, edges represent the presence of a specified interaction between actors, and attractors are added in the latent level to capture the notion of attractive and repulsive forces over time. For inference of these forces and the underlying latent positions, we offer both a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and a stochastic gradient descent method, the latter with a novel variance estimation algorithm. We apply the CLSNA models to understand the dynamics of partisan polarization on social media, where we expect US Republicans and Democrats to increasingly interact with their own party and disengage with the opposing party. Our analysis confirms the existence of partisan polarization in social media interactions among both political elites and the public. Moreover, while attractive partisanship is the driving force of interactions across the full periods of study for both the public and Democratic elites, repulsive partisanship has come to dominate Republican elites' interactions since the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.  This is joint work with Xiaojing Zhu, Hancong Pan, Kostas Spiliopoulos, Dylan Walker, Dino Christenson, and Cantay Caliskan.

                  <b>Konstantinos Fokianos</b> (University of Cyprus): Spatio-Temporal Count Autorgression
                  <div class="publication-authors">
                    <b>Abstract:</b>  We study the problem of modeling and inference for spatio-temporal count processes. Our approach uses parsimonious parameterisations of multivariate autoregressive count time series models, including possible regression on covariates. We control the number of parameters by specifying spatial neighbourhood structures for possibly huge matrices that take into account spatio-temporal dependencies. This work is motivated by real data applications which call for suitable models. Extensive simulation studies show that our approach yields reliable estimators.
